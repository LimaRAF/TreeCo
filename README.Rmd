# TreeCo

An R Package to Manage TreeCo Database

## Installation

You can install the released version of TreeCo from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
library("remotes")
install_github("LimaRAF/TreeCo")
library("TreeCo")
```

## Note

The package is being slowly constructed, with many 
functions pending to be included in the package
and properly documented. 


<!-- ## Example -->

<!-- This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: -->

<!-- ```{r example} -->
<!-- ## basic example code -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub! -->
